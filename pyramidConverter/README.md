The graphical user interface should be opened from the MatLab script 'combineScript_parallel.m' (found in the pyramidConverter folder). 

The figure below shows that:

1. The image pyramid levels that are available in the file are printed in the Command Window for gaining information.
2. The 'SeriesName' index (in the printed table) should be entered as the 'Max. desired resolution'.
3. Meanwhile, the multi-pol images to export should be thicked on in the selection menu (top left).

The current computer system specification are given in the panel below. The size of the processed image cannot be larger than the Java 'MaxHeapSize' at any time to avoid crashing the process. 

Running smoothly requires having a JDK installation (Java for developers) and changing the MaxHeapSize to accommodate larger images at any given time.
