The mineral list in this document will be parsed in a MatLab script to merge minerals with similar spectra. The process is reversible by modifying the text after the last '=' and much faster than mergin spectral masks within AZtec v3.3 software.

Option 1: The phases can be identified looking at the spectra within AZtec 'phase image - phases and spectra with miniquant (Landscape).pdf' report. 

Option 2: Alternatively, the saved phase_map_rgb.tif (MatLab script) can be aligned with an optical microscopy scan and compared to obtain the rock-forming minerals. All exported AZtec mineral phase masks must have the same dimensions (WxH) and be perfectly aligned.

For writing the user input (mergin criteria), follow the format below prior use of our phase mask exporting convention. The element/mineral order in the example below does not matter. Using the *.tif or *.tiff format is optional. The automatic parsing only recognizes [a-zA-Z_0-9] characters.
