# Acevedo-Kamber
Scripts of the petrographic image analysis pipeline (Option A and Option B). The input can be multi-pol optical scans of a full thin-section that have been downloaded from OlyVIA (Olympus ASW) software via a server access. See the full description in Acevedo Zamora and Kamber (2023) Suplementary material 1.
